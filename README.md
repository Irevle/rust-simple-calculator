# simple-calculator
This is a simple calculator that I make in Rust. It takes two numbers and an operand and it will give you the result. It can do addition, substraction, multiplication, and raise to a power.

<sub>I just remembered that explaining the code using comments is actually a good idea. Silly me.</sub>
